# Tricksy Battle

## Description
Tricksy Battle is a simple two-player card game played with a modified standard deck (no Kings). Players take turns playing cards, following suit when possible, and scoring points based on who plays the higher card in the lead suit.

The game ends after 16 rounds, or early if a player reaches 9 points while the other player has at least 1. If a player wins 16â€“0, they "shoot the moon" and win with 17 points.

This version is implemented for two human players in the terminal using Python.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the game using the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```
